# Distribution of text and pub types

- Create a dataset and understand the distribution of PubMed search results' abstract type (unstructured, structured, none), full-text availability (proxy for paywalled articles), and publication type (assigned via indexing). 
- We will create these distributions for each of the three following: the total results of the queries, the articles the users click on, and the top 10 results turned for the queries.
